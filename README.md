# Idea Board  :bulb:
<br>
This is a CRUD app created in React that allows users to create a board of ideas that can be deleted and sorted by date, or alphabetically. It is the take-home technical test for the FinTech company Clear Score.
</br>
</br>
At the start, I wanted to keep things simple, so I started with just displaying the title on each card. But as I got more comfortable with the project, I pushed myself to add more features. One of the things I came up with was a character countdown in the message body, which was a fun addition.
</br>
</br>
Another aspect I worked on was implementing sorting capabilities. Now, users can sort their entries by date or alphabetically, making it easier to organize and find specific items.

## User Stories
&check;  The page must be fully responsive.
</br>
</br>
&check;  Each idea tile should contain a title and description, which is editable, as well as created/updated time.
</br>
</br>
&check;  New ideas should have the title field focused to prompt the user to begin typing.
</br>
</br>
&check;  Add the ability to sort ideas by creation date or alphabetically.


## Lessons Learned
- How to sort alphabetically and by date.

- Adding a character countdown.

- Conditional rendering based on if the user is editing a card.
